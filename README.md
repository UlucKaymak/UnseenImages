# 🎨 Unseen Images
**Unseen Images** is a deconstructive visual art project that produces visual sensory data without showing the main image behind the data.

## 🖼️ Features
- Fetches artworks from selected Museum archives and selected keywords
- Downloads the image and extracts dominant colors
- Generates a color palette preview
- Posts the artwork’s title, artist, and palette image on Twitter
- Avoids reposting previously shared artworks by tracking used IDs

### Personal note
I started this project before I saw what a racist, misogynistic and other kind of garbage place Twitter is. I quit because I grew disappointment with the platform over time.
